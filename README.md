[![.NET](https://github.com/iberisoft/ExtractDicom/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iberisoft/ExtractDicom/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

This tool extracts DICOM files compressed and protected by passwords. A user should open a source folder as the DICOM disc root and a target folder to extract DICOM files.
It is expected to contain at least one password-protected 7z archive file on the disc.
